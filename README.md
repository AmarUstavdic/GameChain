# ChainBattles: Powered by Kademlia DHT and Blockchain - A Decentralized Battleship Game

Welcome to ChainBattles, a decentralized battleship game that leverages the power of Kademlia DHT and blockchain technology. This project aims to develop a SIMPLE turn-based 2-player game that runs on a decentralized P2P network of players. The game incorporates the Wesolowski Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) as the blockchain consensus algorithm to ensure trust and safety in a peer-to-peer multiplayer game architecture.

ChainBattles offers a unique and secure gaming experience where players can engage in battleship warfare on a decentralized network. It utilizes the Kademlia distributed hash table (DHT) protocol for peer-to-peer networking, ensuring a decentralized and resilient gaming environment. The game also incorporates blockchain technology, utilizing the Wesolowski VDF consensus algorithm, to enhance security and provide trust and integrity for battleship moves, player interactions, and game outcomes.
